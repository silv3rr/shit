## WTF is this SHIT

Oh, thanks for asking! 🤮

It's a release tool for (live) mp3 groups: ftp, fixes rls, (auto)tag/pack and spread/pre

includes irc bot, web interface and uses cbftp as ftp client

and all jewtricks to win live should be be included (and possible retail too)

..you probably do not need nor want this, at all.

## Usage

settings are in config.php and config.js

set password, host ip, irc server/port, channel, paths, and ofc ur shitty rls group

### irc

join chan and try `!help`

some commands such as `!addip` also work in privmsg

- spread, pre
- call cbftp rest api (`!addsite` etc)
- control glftpd (`!addip` etc)
- newdir/pre announces by bot
- fish w/ keyx and cbc supported

### web

goto https://yourip (nginx), make sure your client ip is allowed and you use correct password

- view status, click thingies to start/stop services
- use filemanager, edit configs
- run cbftp in browser terminal (chrome only)
- delip/addip to glftp

### Standard mode

local os install using apt/sudo/systemd etc, setup instructions: [STANDARD.md](docs/STANDARD.md)

### Docker mode

install in containers: [DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md)

### Config

configuration and settings for both modes: [CONFIG.md](docs/CONFIG.md)
